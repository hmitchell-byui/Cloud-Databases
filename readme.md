# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
My intention for creating this project is to dip my toes into the world of cloud databases. Building and exploring databases is what I want to do in a future career. 
{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a Cloud Database. Describe how to use your program.}
My program is written in python and accesses a google cloud database firestore. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I wrote this software as a trial run for using various cloud databases. It was a good learning experience to integrate a program to the cloud.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}
